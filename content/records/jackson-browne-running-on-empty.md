all right mother fuckers i'm gonna set the tone by being _E X T R E M E L Y   U N C O O L_ yall ready

of the records i was considering, this is without question the lamest and dadliest but it's also the one i have the most to say about, and also the one that reminds me the most of the time in my life when i met most of you folks

so this album is basically my mother

dumb uncool humor and all

those moments when you could totally tell she was too dorky to hang out with the hippies she hung out with

when she divorced her first husband, who had one of those legendary rock collections, she got to keep a fair number of records

when she married my dad, she used to listen to that kinda stuff all the time

television, jeff beck group, etc. good stuff

after a while, my dad started to bristle about all these great records, the collest things in their otherwise nerdy home, sitting around, all of 

them with this big bold signature of her ex-husband on them

is how the story goes

and she put em away, and from my earliest memories they only listened to classical music in the house

when i was 12, there was an intervention on my dad, detox and six months of rehab and all

first time he'd been gone for that long

we drove to see an old friend of hers in colorado, her friend had all these records too, like....a tribe called quest? isn't that, like, _rap?_ 

but isn't tina like a _white lady_, who's a _mom?_

it was a shitty time in most of the big ways, but it was also my mom getting back in touch with things she'd discarded when she became a mother

when we got home, empty house, dad gone until the wintertime, this was the first record my mom put on

> also "Rosie" is about yanking it

This is a good album

This is the sort of country-blues teenage nostalgia Americana genre of 70s rock that my mom never listened to and I sometimes feel like I missed 
out on good stuff

I never really paid any attention to a Springsteen song until Lily started playing them for me

I still can’t get into the Eagles or steely dan

But I like this Jackson Browne stuff

---

> "the loadout / stay" fucking slays

It’s one of the first pop songs I ever learned on piano

Soon I learned Rosie because it was more relatable than a wistful ballad about roadies

Then later I found out The Load Out was actually about love

---

Oh also this band

Carole King, Linda Ronstadt, James Taylor, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, and Warren Zevon also enjoyed the services of this band

Like how the 60s pop stars had the Wrecking Crew, or Motown had the Funk Brothers or the Muscle Shoals Swampers

A brilliant, uncredited house band who played on a hundred records you know

These guys were called the Mellow Mafia

They once got in a brawl with an abusive boyfriend of Carole King’s, between encores, while she waited onstage

I have yr album rockin’ on my receiver rn

The single rules, of course

My parents’ vinyl collection has opened my eyes to a lot of 70's music, for sure

They have his self-titled, For Everyman, and The Pretender, but I can already tell Running On Empty is better than all of them

wait holy shit… the title track really _is_ a live recording?

I thought that clapping was dubbed in

this is a _live_ album

I’m blown away

The cross-fade of The Road from studio to live!!  That rules!!

dude, these lyrics make it v clear to me why yr mom put this record on first, with yr dad gone

>You love the thunder, and you love the rain —
>What you see revealed within the anger is worth the pain.
>And before the lightning fades and you surrender,
>You’ve got a second to look at the dark side of the man.

--- 

it's a live album and a backstage doodling album

--- 
So I am learning!!

It sounds very good, given that

---
that's why i was nerding out about the backing band

would you like to see a picture of bassist Leland Sklar

---

> yes

I listened to your album once, maybe Monday

I've started it again

It's just what I need for late morning work energy.

Can we talk about lyrics? Do you like these?

I feel like Browne’s lyrics are approachable because they’re like 60% fine, 20% beautiful and 10% bad

There’s always a line like “so many summer fields” or “half grown female pup” that makes me go “ooh, might want to punch that one up”

But when he’s good he’s so good it punches through the schmaltz and you’re like, it me, I’m the pretender

Am I seeing this through nostalgia and the lyrics are just bland, like Christgau thinks?

---

Did Browne write most/all of his own lyrics?

---

yeah, he was a songwriter first

he wrote Take It Easy for the Eagles

he wrote These Days for Nico

---

Way to make me hate and love a dude

---

he did date nico

>double love for that

---

I think I would lose my mind if I was at a show and any band played The Load Out and Stay

>_It was their first run-through of the song_

---

thank you guys for enjoying this dorkass record with me

--- 

>I can’t emphasize enough that “Rosie” is about jerking off
